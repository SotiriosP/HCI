# HCI
# From A to Z: An Interactive Game-Based Mobile Learning Tool for Improving Literacy Skills in Children


# Applications purpose:

-> Teach the alphabet and word formation

-> Build vocabulary and spelling skills

-> Provide pronunciation and visual aids

-> Offer engaging games and activities

-> Personalize learning based on level and progress

-> Provide progress tracking and feedback

-> Include a reward system for motivation

-> Create a safe and child-friendly environment

# Target audience:

-> Elementary school-aged children

-> Parents and homeschooling parents

-> Teachers and tutors working with children

# Libraries

The app uses the standard Android SDK (Software Development Kit) libraries, which are included in the Android platform and do not require additional installation. Some of the SDK libraries that are used in this code are: android.os.Bundle, android.widget.Button, android.widget.TextView, android.widget.EditText, android.widget.Toast, java.util.ArrayList, etc.

# Further Improvements

1. Add alternative input methods: The program can be modified to include alternate input methods like voice commands or switch access for kids with disabilities that restrict their ability to use touchscreens or keyboards

2. Provide customizable options: Children with certain disabilities may need customization options such as adjusting the size of text, icons, and buttons, or changing the colors of the interface to suit their individual needs

3. Improved user interface: The user interface can be improved to make it more aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly. The user experience would improve if there were more interactive components, sound effects, and animations
4.More game modes: The app only has one game mode right now. The game would be more difficult and interesting if there were more game modes with varying degrees of difficulty

5. Collaborate with disability advocacy groups: By collaborating with disability advocacy groups, developers can gain insight into the needs and preferences of children with disabilities, and ensure that the app is designed with accessibility and inclusivity in mind

6. Internationalization: Making the app available in more languages would expand its user base. This would entail localizing the app's content into several languages and ensuring that its user interface can support various character sets
